 <h2>Blessing Madhuma</h2> 
 <p>Hello there, this is Blessing, l am a member of the Church for 7 years now.
    l think l like about the church is the opportunity to grow through giving talks in sacrament
    meetings. l have to give one this coming Sunday 18th of September.
 </p>
 <p>l am single, am from Zimbabwe, Mutare, and currently residing in South Africa, Pretoria.
    The things l love most about BYU-Idaho is how the lessons are taught in a spiritual context.
 </p> 
 <p>Am looking forward to learn and grow with you all.</p>
