        <h1>Personal Savings</h1>
       <p>
        They say, 'Tomorrow is not promised to anyone', Techworld makes it possible and flexable for you to decide how much you want to deposite 
        in your savings account without visiting your bank branch. You can also access your savings where ever you are without charges.
        There is no minimum deposite amount, meaning you can start saving with an amount that works for you. Do not wait to grab this opportunity 
        and start to invest in your future with us.

        Our personal savings accounts are flexable such that you can do withdrawals of up to a maximum of $1000 without any notice or delay. However, you
        just need to give a three day notice to withdraw any amount above $1000. All you need is to press the order through your mobile app or website, again from the 
        comfort of you home.
